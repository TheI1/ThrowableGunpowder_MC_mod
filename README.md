# ThrowableGunpowder_MC_mod

<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/throwable-gunpowder">Go to the Curseforge page</a>

ThisÂ highly configurable Minecraft mod lets you throw and dispense gunpowder as an explosive projectile.

Because gunpowder is renewable and infinitely farmable without a player, this mod can help you make a completely automatic cobblestone farm without using glitches or withers! Or you could use it for mining or, of course, blowing up your friends base! (:

This mod may be used in modpacks.
